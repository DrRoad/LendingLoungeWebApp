					<h3>Amateur Investors Need Help</h3>
					<p>Amateur investors, myself included, generally need as much help as they can get. When investing in peer-to-peer loans, we tend to devise heuristic strategies with no (or very little) data to back up their efficacy. Sometimes we'll look at the debt-to-income ratio of borrowers. Other times the annual income or the profession. These strategies lead to marginal returns and eventual frustration with the peer-to-peer lending system.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this project is to create a data-driven investment strategy for loans on the Lending Club marketplace, using the metric of highest estimated ROI.</p>

					<h3>What This Project Is Not</h3>
					<p>Let me get the caveats out of the way first.
					Alternative investments are intended for qualified and suitable investors only. Alternative Investments such as peer-to-peer loans can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative Investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.</p>

					</p>
					<p>A number of simplifying assumptions have been made, which should be carefully scrutinized.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Without having access to the detailed payment history of each borrower, I have had to make assumptions about when and how they pay their installments. For example, in the case of prepayment, all I know is the total amount of money paid and the date of the last payment. I therefore assumed that the borrower made normal monthly payments until the last payment, where they then paid the remaining principle in full.</li>
						<p></p>
						<li>No fees. I have not included any of the fees charged by Lending Club.</li>
						<p></p>
						<li>36 month loans originating before 2013. I focused solely on 36 month loans to simplify the analysis. A next step is to extend this to the 60 month loans. In addition, I only incorporated loans originating before 2013 because loans having originated after this have not yet had a chance to mature (as of jan 2015). These newer loans would therefore throw off both the default rate and the prepayment rate.</li>

						<h3>Dataset Overview</h3>
						<p>The dataset from Lending Club consists of details for over 300,000 loans originating since 2007. Of these, almost 100,000 have either been fully paid or have been charged off. These are the loans used in this project. This project has been restricted to only using 36-month term loans.</p>
						<p>In the LC dataset are a number of features on the borrower's credit: debt-to-income ratio, credit score range, number of open credit card accounts, income, etc. These data have been augmented by unemployment rates in the borrower's state (Bureau of Labor Statistics) and the 3-year swap interest rate, taken as an indicator of the risk-free interest rate.</p>
						<p>As seen in the plot on the left, only 27% of loans are paid back following the schedule prescribed by lending club. 57% are paid back early, and 16% default. It is therefore critical for an investor to be able to estimate the probability of prepayment and default, as well as the expected time for it to happen.</p>
						<p>Below, you can explore the annual income, as well as a few other pieces of financial information, for borrowers on a per-state basis. For example, you will find that NJ borrowers have the highest average income of nearly $83K. It's also interesting to note (lower panel) that borrowers with grade G loans tend to have the highest annual income, but also the highest debt-to-income ratio.</p>

					<h3>Time to Default</h3>
						<p>Defaults are one of the biggest risks for a peer-to-peer investor. When a default occurs, the investors not only lose future income, but also the principle they had invested in the loan to begin with.</p>
						<p>Even though 16% of all loans default, they do so at different times in their lives. As seen in the plot on the right, loans tend to default rather early, with relatively few defaulting after 24 months.</p>
						<p>In addition to being able to buy a stake in a loan when it originates, investors can also trade notes with one another, provided they are not currently late or in default. This is another reason why it's critical to understand when a loan is expected to default.</p>

				<h3>Time to Prepayment</h3>
					<p>Borrowers on LC are free to pay back the balance of their loans early if they choose - there is no prepayment fee. Surprisingly, 57% of borrowers did just that within the first 33 months of their loan term. From an investor's perspective, a prepaid loan is not as bad as a default. It is, however, lost revenue as the principle needs to make its way through the LC platform, and then will sit for at least a week until it can be invested in a new loan.</p>

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Three pieces of information were desired from the analysis:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>1. Probability of Default / Prepay / Full Payment</li>
							<li>2. If a loan defaults/is prepaid, when is it likely to occur</li>
							<li>3. Given 1 and 2, what is the expected ROI</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The data was carefully examined for outliers, correlated features, incorrect data, and to get an overall impression of the dataset (a USPS driver was incorrectly listed as making $7 million dollars a year, for instance).</p>
						<p>After the exploratory analysis, the data was cleaned and the categorical variables were binarized. It was at this step that outside economic data was incorporated for each borrower's location and issue year. Following the cleaning process, the data was loaded into an Amazon AWS MySQL server to allow easy access and integrity.</p>

					<h3>Classification - Logistic Regression</h3>
						<p>Determining the probability that a loan will default, be prepaid, or be fully paid was handled through an application of a logistic regression algorithm, as implemented by scikit-learn. Each feature was scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. It was then split into 3 distinct groups - a training group consisting of 90% of the data, a cross-validation group with 10%, and a final testing group with 2000 loans.</p>
						<p>After cross-validating the logistic regression with a regularization parameter, it was found that a value of C = 0.01 led to the accuracy, precision, and recall values on the cross-validation set shown in the table on the left.</p>

					<h3>Regression - Random Forest</h3>
						<p>To estimate how long it would take for a given loan to default or be prepaid, a random forest regressor was employed. Initially, a linear regression was used, but the overall fit and predictive abilities were too poor for the application.</p>
						<p>To put the defaulted, prepaid, and fully paid loans on an equal footing, a metric called "months to zero value" was employed, where a loan reaches zero value (from the investor's persepctive) when it defaults or is fully paid off. For example, a loan which is paid according to the Lending Club schedule will have a months to zero value of 36.</p>
						<p>Through a cross-validation process, it was found that 100 trees in the forest resulted in a converged value of for the coefficient of determination (r-squared) of 0.60 (see plot).</p>

						<h3>Case Study</h3>
						<p>The purpose of this project was to aid me in making investments in peer-to-peer loans. It was therefore critical to do a case study following a usual investment strategy for a small-time investor. 2000 A, B, and C grade loans originating in 2011 and 2012 were chosen at random. These loans were not included in the training or cross-validation sets for the algorithms. Of these, a given number were chosen from each grade and tracked for their ROI. How the 30 loans out of the possible 2000 were chosen is where it gets interesting.</p>
						<p><b>Strategy 1: Random </b>The first strategy was to choose the loans from each grade at random. This happens more than you might imagine (at least in my naive case). The error bars are one standard deviation, acquired after repeating the random selection 100 times.</p>
						<p><b>Strategy 2: Lowest DTI </b>The second strategy was to choose loans from the borrowers with the lowest debt-to-income ratio, a common strategy among amateur investors.</p>
						<p><b>Strategy 3: Highest Interest Rate </b>The third strategy was to pick the loans in each grade with the highest interest rate. This mimicks the approach of a novice investor.</p>
						<p><b>Strategy 4: Lending Lounge - Highest Est. ROI </b>The fourth and final strategy was to choose the loans from each grade with the highest estimated return on investment, as predicted through the above analysis.</p>
						<p>The results are shown in the plot on the left. For this specific case, the loans chosen through Lending Lounge provided nearly twice the return of the next best strategy, assuming you invested in more than ~25 loans per grade. For those interested in the statistical significance of the findings, the table on the left shows the p-values corresponding to the returns from Lending Lounge vs random choice.</p>
